## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my profile!
Iâ€™m a junior QA professional with a passion for delivering quality in every aspect of a product. While I didnâ€™t begin my career in quality assurance, I quickly found my calling hereâ€”QA is about much more than catching bugs; itâ€™s about understanding the bigger picture, refining processes, and ensuring that every user has a seamless experience. Now, Iâ€™m on a mission to grow my skills and bring a detail-oriented, proactive approach to quality.
