## Hi there 👋
I’m a junior QA professional with a passion for delivering quality in every aspect of a product. While I didn’t begin my career in quality assurance, I quickly found my calling here—QA is about much more than catching bugs; it’s about understanding the bigger picture, refining processes, and ensuring that every user has a seamless experience. Now, I’m on a mission to grow my skills and bring a detail-oriented, proactive approach to quality.
