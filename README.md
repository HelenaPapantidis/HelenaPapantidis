## Hi there I'm Helena Papantidis ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my profile!

QA Engineer with experience in manual, automated, and API testing using tools like Selenium Java TestNG, WDIO, Cypress, API Postman. Skilled in using bug tracking systems like Jira and TestRail to ensure smooth functionality and user-friendly performance. Focused on teamwork and finding practical solutions to deliver reliable and high-quality results. I may not have started my career in quality assurance, but I quickly found my passion hereâ€”QA is about understanding the bigger picture, improving processes, and ensuring seamless user experiences. Now, Iâ€™m on a mission to grow my skills and bring a detail-oriented, proactive approach to every project.

**My Experience and Skills:**

**Manual Testing:** I have hands-on experience in manual testing, where I created test cases and designed test scenarios for both web and mobile applications. My focus was on user flows such as registration, login, and ticket reservation on the SrbijaVoz and Benefiti.rs application. I identified bugs, documented issues, and reported them clearly using tools like Jira and Trello.

ðŸ’» **Automated Testing:** Developed and maintained robust automated testing frameworks using Selenium with Java, as well as WebdriverIO and Cypress with JavaScript. Created comprehensive end-to-end and regression test suites to validate key functionalities and ensure application stability.

ðŸ”— **API Testing:** I used Postman to validate the applicationâ€™s back-end, performing API tests to ensure that all requests and responses were correct. This process helped me ensure that the server-side operations worked seamlessly with the front-end.

ðŸ“Š **SQL Testing:** I also utilized SQL for database verification, writing and running queries to ensure that data integrity was maintained throughout different operations in the application.

**Training and Certifications:**
ðŸŽ“ Iâ€™ve completed a comprehensive Manual and Automated Testing course through OIK Poslovna SavrÅ¡enost, Belgrade, which deepened my understanding of core testing principles, methodologies, and strategies. Additionally, I hold the ISTQB Foundation Level (CTFL) certification, demonstrating my knowledge of international testing standards and best practices.

ðŸ“š Additionally, I have taken various Udemy courses, including ones focused on Manual Testing and Selenium and Playwright, which enhanced my ability to design and execute automated test scripts efficiently.

**What Iâ€™m Currently Learning:**
ðŸŒ± I am currently expanding my knowledge in advanced testing techniques, exploring continuous integration tools like Jenkins, and delving deeper into AI-driven test automation tools like Testim.io and Mabl.

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate with others in the QA field, exchange experiences, and continue growing my expertise in test automation and QA methodologies.

**Fun Fact:**
âš¡ I think of QA like solving a mysteryâ€”finding patterns, identifying hidden bugs, and improving every product layer to make sure it works perfectly for the user.
